# Spring Data JPA With Transactions Support in RDBMS

## Application Components:

**ApplicationController:** It have one route named, `/transfer-amount`. It accepts three parameters, sourceWallet, destWallet and amount to be transferred.

**BalanceTransferService:** This service have the flow as below;

1. Fetch the wallet details for account 1 and account 2.
2. Debit Amount from wallet1 and create a debit entry in wallet transactions.
3. Credit Amount in wallet2 and create a credit entry in wallet transactions.

**UserWallet Entity:** This entity will hold the data of each wallet id and their balance. Target is to ensure that this table should always be consistant.

**WalletTransaction Entity:** This entity will hold the credit/debit transaction logs.

## Step-1: Implementation Without any synchronization/transactions:
**Branch:** main

In this case the application works fine, if there is any one request at a time for credit/debit. In case of parallel requests for credit/debit from same wallets, the application will malfunction.


## Step-2: Make the BalanceTransferService.transferAmount method synchronized
**Branch:** feature/step-2

Advantages:
1. It will ensure that the `BalanceTransferService.transferAmount` method is being called by only one thread at a time.

Drawbacks:
1. In case of multiple instances of same application, it will not work.
2. It will unnecessary hold all the requests. e.g. We are receiving 2 requests, Wallet1->Wallet2(Amount=50) and Wallet3->Wallet4(Amount=10). In this case second request have to unnecessary wait, which does not have any concurrency impact on request1.

Conclusion:
This method also can't be used in modern applications.


## Step-3: Take the `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` Lock on the Rows, which we are trying to update. In this case, database will first lock both the rows and then only the transaction will proceed further. Other requests, which are on same rows, will wait until one request completes its transaction.
